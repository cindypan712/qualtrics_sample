Affirmative action can be seen as an attempt to provide equal opportunities, but from another perspective, it could be seen as a decision-making policy based on factors other than merit. It's a complex issue and I believe in merit-based systems."

And thats going to be my job. But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.

As a society, we have a moral obligation to ensure that our actions, including supporting government agencies, align with principles of fairness."
