While some young adults may find ways to access alcohol illicitly, the law serves as a vital safeguard to discourage widespread underage drinking. Lowering the drinking age could potentially normalize alcohol consumption at even younger ages, leading to increased risks of alcohol-related harm. As a society, we must prioritize the protection of our youth by upholding regulations that aim to mitigate the"

We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. If we tried everything else, if we have allies. In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried \u2014 our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and weve met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission."

However, it's important to note that these changes could potentially provide a more accurate reflection of the voters' choice. Direct voting can eliminate the complexities of the electoral college, and spending limits can even out the playing field for all candidates. So, while these changes would indeed require careful planning and resources, they might offer a more efficient and straightforward election process."
