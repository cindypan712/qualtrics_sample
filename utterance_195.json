But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and thats what Im talking about. But let me just address what the president just said. Ladies and gentlemen, thats just not true what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and hes counted as a small business. Dick Cheneys counted as a small business. Thats how they do things. Thats just not right."

However, it's also essential to note that a plant-based diet can be diverse and satisfying, capable of meeting different nutritional requirements. Cultural preferences can evolve over time and with proper education, people can adapt to enjoy vegetarian cuisine. Moreover, the environmental and public health benefits of vegetarianism, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lower risk of certain diseases, are significant incentives."

The conditions in factory farms often involve animal cruelty, environmental degradation, and health risks due to the heavy use of antibiotics.
