I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare. We need to reform Medicare. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it. And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned. If youre happy with the system you can stay in it. But there are a lot of procedures that havent kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132, 000- page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, lets come together. Youve had your chance, Vice President, youve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3. 4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years. My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D. C. Its going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide."

Can we really justify diverting resources abroad when there are many here who feel forgotten by their own country? Yes, trade partnerships and job opportunities sound promising, but what assurance do we have that the benefits of these advancements will trickle down to our most vulnerable citizens?"

        "text": "Weve got to do both, and thats exactly what my plan does. Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late- 50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, theyre worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. So heres what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you dont have to do anything. If youve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. The only thing were going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average familys premium by about $2, 500 per year. If you dont have health insurance, then what were going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high- quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. Were going to make sure that insurance companies cant discriminate on the basis of pre- existing conditions. Well negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. Weve got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but its also how were going to save the federal budget, because we cant afford these escalating costs."

While regulation could provide some level of control, the potential normalization and commercialization of marijuana could overshadow the intended harm reduction efforts. It is essential to consider the broader societal implications and long-term consequences of legalizing marijuana, especially in terms of public health and the well-being of our communities."

It is important to promote transparency through legal and ethical means that uphold the safety and well-being of all individuals involved."
