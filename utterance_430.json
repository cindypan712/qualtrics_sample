I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and thats why I took the position I took. I think its important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President."

We need to find a more sustainable solution that doesn't jeopardize our own children's future."

It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And yes, I think its something that people need to consider. This isnt something new.
