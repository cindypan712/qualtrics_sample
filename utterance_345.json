Every child deserves to have enough food to eat, regardless of their family's circumstances. Federal nutrition programs play a vital role in ensuring that basic necessity is met.

However, I see your point that reducing plastic waste doesn't mean overlooking other issues. But, what if our efforts to reduce plastic inadvertently exacerbate other problems? What if, in our haste, we create new challenges, like job loss in the plastic industry, or skyrocketing costs of alternatives? There's a balance to be struck, don't you"

A study by Harvard Business School on 29 OECD countries revealed a negative correlation between government size and economic growth. Specifically, for every 10% increase in government spending, economic growth decreased by 0.5 to 1%.
