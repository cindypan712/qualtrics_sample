Affirmative action, when implemented thoughtfully and fairly, can help break the cycle of disadvantage and create a more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. By addressing historical injustices and promoting diversity, we move closer to achieving true equality and justice for all individuals. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that."

So 80% \u2014 now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%. The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle- class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle- class families. And so lets do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top."

Research has shown that when individuals feel their rights are respected and protected, they are more likely to cooperate with authorities and uphold societal norms. Therefore, rather than hindering law enforcement efforts, upholding civil liberties can contribute to a safer and more harmonious society overall."
