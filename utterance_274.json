I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington."

By not fully cooperating with federal immigration authorities, sanctuary cities risk enabling individuals who have committed serious crimes to evade deportation. This can potentially pose a threat to public safety by allowing dangerous individuals to remain in the community. Therefore, prioritizing immigration status over other criminal activities may have negative repercussions on the overall safety and well-being of the community."

By leveraging the bargaining power of a larger Medicare program, we can negotiate lower drug prices, streamline administrative processes, and implement cost-saving measures to ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system. This holistic approach will not only improve access to care but also tackle the root causes of high healthcare spending and disparities."

However, what if the union demands are so high that they risk the survival of the small business? It's not always about motivation and productivity. Sometimes, it's about the harsh reality of meeting financial obligations without going bankrupt. The balance you speak of is hard to strike when the demands of the union leave the business owner teetering on the edge of ruin. It's a heartbreaking scenario, seeing dreams shattered and livelihood"

Instead of banning books, we should focus on promoting critical thinking skills and providing counter-narratives to challenge harmful ideologies. Education and open dialogue are more effective in combating hate speech than censorship."

However, it's worth noting that the EPA, in its current form, is already involved in various collaborative efforts for environmental protection. Thus, strengthening it might just mean improving what's already there rather than creating something new. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on the role of the EPA in its current state."
