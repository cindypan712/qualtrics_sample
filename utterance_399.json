And I think that theres a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesnt get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. Ive worked on this issue. Its an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, thats one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming together, as I said, theyre looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post- war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, its time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role."

Numerous studies have indicated that children raised in LGBTQ+ households perform just as well as their peers in various areas such as academics and social interactions. There's a large number of children in foster care who need stable homes. Allowing LGBTQ+ individuals to become parents can significantly reduce this number."

Rather than seeking to diminish this diversity, we should learn to respect and value the different viewpoints that exist."

Weve been through a lot together as a country \u2014 been through a recession, corporate scandals, war. And yet think about where we are; Added 1. 9 million new jobs over the past 13 months. The farm income in America is high. Small businesses are flourishing. Homeownership rate is at an all- time high in America. Were on the move. Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going; keep the taxes low, dont increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And abroad, were at war. And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined. I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until were safe. The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe. There is more work to be done. Well stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. Well deny sanctuary to these terrorists. Well make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. Its the great nexus. The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction. But our long- term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. And well continue to promote freedom around the world. Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president. In Iraq, well be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful. God bless."

For instance, a secure environment can influence foreign investments, which are vital for economic growth. In addition, a robust defense system can deter potential threats, leading to stability that's conducive for other sectors to operate efficiently. Therefore, it's pragmatic to prioritize national security initiatives."

By imposing trade barriers and regulations, we can safeguard domestic industries from unfair competition and prevent job losses due to outsourcing. The influx of cheap foreign goods can lead to the decline of American manufacturing, resulting in higher unemployment rates. Restricting globalization can help maintain a balance that ensures the prosperity of our economy and the well-being of our workforce."
