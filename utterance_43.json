When individuals face disproportionately severe penalties for minor offenses, they may become further marginalized and disconnected from society, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. By focusing on rehabilitation alongside appropriate consequences, we can address the underlying causes of criminal behavior and help individuals reintegrate into society as productive members. This approach not only promotes long-term public safety but also fosters a more compassionate and effective justice system."
