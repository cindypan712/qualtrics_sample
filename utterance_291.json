        "text": "Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short- term component, but also a long- term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short- term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long- term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And Im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution, that dont burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, well then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future. I dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of Americas environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology."

Not everyone has equal access to quality financial education or the means to save enough for retirement. Reliance on individual savings could lead to financial insecurity for those who are less advantaged. Therefore, it's essential to maintain Social Security as a safety net for these individuals."

        "text": "Let me comment on that. Im not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way its got to be. We can help. And maybe its just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just dont think its the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you. \u00e2\u20ac\u009d I think we can help. I know weve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdins pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. Theyre going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, theres a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but its their call to make. So Im not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do it this way, so should you. \u00e2\u20ac\u009d Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where youre coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course."

Legalizing polygamy is not about undermining traditional marriages, but about accommodating various perspectives. It's about respecting individual choices in defining relationships.

By implementing effective mechanisms for case review and decision-making, it's possible to expand the use of these tools without significantly slowing down other essential operations. How do you think we could optimize resources to manage the potential impact of an expanded pardon and commutation system?"

In some cases, the enforcement of these rights can be selective and influenced by geopolitical interests, leading to inconsistencies in how human rights are prioritized. Additionally, focusing solely on human rights without considering other factors such as economic development, social stability, and cultural norms may not always lead to sustainable improvements in overall well-being. It's essential to strike a balance"
