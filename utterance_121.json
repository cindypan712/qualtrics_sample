However, an integration of these aspects, when handled with care and inclusivity, could offer a more comprehensive decision-making process that takes both moral and ethical values into account. By including religious views with political ones, we can aim for policies that are fair and representative of the diverse belief systems in our society. This could result in a more in-depth understanding of societal problems."

Not only \u2014 Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities."

There's also a component of representation and diversity to consider. Instead of outright dismissal, perhaps we could examine it in a broader context. There could be aspects we've overlooked."

By the way, when Im subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. But the important thing is \u2014 the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. Senator Obama doesnt seem to understand there is a connected between the two."

But envision a world where we suffocate mass media, where we shackle the free exchange of ideas and information. Isn't that a chilling thought too? Imagine the frustration, the desperation of a society deprived of its primary source of information. Instead, let's kindle hope and courage in our hearts to face the challenges of the media landscape. Let's foster"
