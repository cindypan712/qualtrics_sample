By keeping up with these changes, we can ensure our systems are up-to-date and reflective of current understanding. This isn't about complicating things, but rather adapting to new realities. Moreover, recognizing diverse identities can lead to more accurate data collection, which can be useful in various fields like social sciences, healthcare, and policy-making."

The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and Ill make them secure."
