By pooling resources and standardizing care, universal health care can actually increase access to a wider range of services for everyone, especially those who may not afford it otherwise. Additionally, centralized decision-making can lead to more coordinated and efficient care delivery, reducing unnecessary procedures and improving overall health outcomes."

Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people. And you cannot keep both promises. If youre in your mid- 40s under the governors plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund. Under my plan it will be \u2014 its solvency will be extended until youre 100. Now that is the difference. And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this. This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future. The reason Social Security \u2014 he says it gets 2%. You know, its not a bank account that just pays back money thats invested. It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on. If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be \u2014 how are you going to keep faith with the seniors? Now let me come directly to your question."

Once such practices become normalized, there could be a shift in societal attitudes towards end-of-life care, potentially undermining efforts to improve palliative care and mental health support for the terminally ill. Moreover, the focus on providing individuals with a choice to end their lives may detract from addressing systemic issues in healthcare that contribute to inadequate pain management"

We can address food insecurity and promote healthy eating habits without further government intervention. It's about finding other effective solutions that do not involve expanding the role of the federal government."

More women in the workforce could contribute to economic growth, driving up GDP. Furthermore, it could open up new markets and industries, as women bring unique perspectives and ideas. This is not about prioritizing women's rights over other issues, but recognizing the potential economic benefits."

Prohibiting marijuana has led to a range of negative consequences, such as disproportionate enforcement in marginalized communities, fueling of illegal drug markets, and hindering access to medical treatment for those in need. By legalizing and regulating marijuana, we can address these ethical issues and create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, balancing personal freedoms with societal well-being."

Rather than focusing on expanding, let's consider the value that the EPA already brings in its present form. It's essential to remain cautious about increasing the power and scope of such agencies."
