Can we really risk our country's future, our children's future, by inviting the influence of a nation known for its lack of transparency and human rights abuses? It's like a chilling wind, making us shiver with fear and uncertainty. We must stand strong, protecting our values and the wellbeing of our people."

This policy promotes inclusivity and fosters a sense of belonging among individuals, ultimately leading to a more cohesive and united nation. By maintaining birthright citizenship, we uphold the principle of equality and provide opportunities for all individuals to contribute to the growth and prosperity of our country."

By investing in preventative care and streamlining processes, we can ensure that quality remains high and waiting times are minimized. Universal health care is not about settling; it's about aiming for a system where everyone receives the care they deserve. Let's not shy away from progress and instead work towards a future where health is a fundamental right for all, not just a privilege for a few."

I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on \u2013 on Guantanamo Bay. On a \u2014 on the way that the Iraq War was conducted. I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and Im happy to say that Ive got a partner thats a good maverick along with me now."

While regulation may offer some level of control, the potential normalization and increased accessibility of marijuana could lead to broader societal acceptance of drug use, ultimately undermining efforts to promote a drug-free and healthy lifestyle. As a society, we must prioritize the well-being of our communities and future generations by upholding the current laws."

They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another. Theres a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess? And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense. Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike. We better get it right now. Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike. I dont think its the issues that turn kids off. I think its the tone. I think its the attitude. I think its a cynicism in Washington and it doesnt have to be that way. Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind. One, could our family endure all this business. And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it. The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D. C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldnt be asking for your vote. Thats what happened in Texas. We worked together. There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga. He is the chairman of the health committee. He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas. Hes a Democrat. I didnt care whether he was a Republican or Democrat. What I cared about is could we work together. Thats what Washington, D. C. needs. And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth. Thats the best way to get people back in the system."

A 2019 Military Times poll found that 58% of active-duty military personnel expressed opposition to the idea of transgender individuals serving in the military. Furthermore, a 2017 study indicated a possible decrease in unit cohesion and morale due to the integration of LGBTQ+ individuals. These empirical findings underscore the need for a more nuanced approach to the issue, taking into account the potential impact on the military\u2019s effectiveness"

In some cases, the pace of globalization may outstrip the capacity of government programs to retrain and redeploy workers effectively. This can result in long-term unemployment, underemployment, and economic hardship for individuals and communities that struggle to adapt. Therefore, while supportive policies are"
