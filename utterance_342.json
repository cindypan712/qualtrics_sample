However, many colleges and universities have adapted their admissions processes to consider a holistic view of each applicant, taking into account factors beyond test scores. As for oversight and evaluation in homeschooling, some states have implemented regulations to monitor students' progress through standardized testing, portfolio reviews, or academic assessments. By ensuring accountability and transparency in homeschooling practices, we can address concerns about educational quality and better prepare students"

By maintaining control over our economic affairs, we can still participate in international trade and cooperation, but in a way that safeguards our citizens. This approach is indeed about finding the right balance where we prioritize our country's long-term resilience over immediate gains."

But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances. I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home. I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation. And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it. Thats what governors end up doing. We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that were confronted with.

While respecting human rights can contribute to stability and prosperity, there are instances where focusing solely on human rights issues may not always lead to the desired outcomes. For example, in countries facing immediate security threats or economic challenges, prioritizing human rights above all else may not be feasible or effective.
