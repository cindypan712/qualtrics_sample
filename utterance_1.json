Mandating vaccinations or other public health measures can sow distrust in healthcare systems and infringe on individuals' rights to make decisions about their own bodies. Instead of resorting to coercive tactics, a more effective approach may involve promoting education."

September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our nation has been on a multi- pronged strategy to keep our country safer. We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy- five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know were after them. Weve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, youre equally as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A. Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And, as well, were pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror. Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people. Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want."

By enhancing screening procedures and intelligence-sharing mechanisms, we can significantly reduce the risks associated with welcoming refugees. Moreover, providing refugees with support and opportunities for integration can foster a sense of belonging and loyalty to their new home, further reducing the likelihood of radicalization or criminal behavior."

It's not about encouraging sexual activity, but about ensuring students receive accurate information. This does not undermine parental roles, but instead, creates a standard level of knowledge for all students."

This is not because I fear potential negative effects, but because I strongly believe in the importance of human touch in all sectors. Using drones may seem impressive, but it does not hold the same level of human interaction and involvement."

And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. Were proud to be here. Mr. President, Im glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. Thats the goal. Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. The measurement is not; Are we safer? The measurement is; Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them \u2014 95 percent come in today uninspected. Thats not good enough. People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X- rayed, but the baggage is. Thats not good enough. Firehouses dont have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program. So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists. I will hunt them down, and well kill them, well capture them. Well do whatever is necessary to be safe. But I pledge this to you, America; I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure."
