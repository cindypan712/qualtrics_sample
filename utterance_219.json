Legalizing polygamy raises complex ethical and practical challenges that cannot be easily resolved by simply accommodating diverse relationship structures. Upholding the value of monogamous relationships as a societal norm does not negate the importance of inclusivity and respect for individual choices but rather prioritizes the greater good and the protection"

Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and thats why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasnt done. But had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is \u2014 is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro- dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil \u2014 25 percent of the worlds oil \u2014 have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off- shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. What were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean- coal technology. And, you know, Ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we \u2014 we \u2014 weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump \u2014 and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil \u2014 as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important."

For one, it allows students to make practical decisions about what to wear based on the day's activities or weather conditions. Moreover, not having uniforms can potentially stimulate the local economy since parents would be purchasing a wider variety of clothing for their children."
