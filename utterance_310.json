For example, in environments requiring strict adherence to norms or safety protocols, individuals with certain neurodivergences may struggle to perform their duties effectively. This could lead to inefficiencies, errors, or safety hazards. It's essential to strike a balance between celebrating neurodiversity and ensuring that all individuals can thrive in their respective roles without compromising productivity or well-being."

Once such practices become normalized, there could be a shift in societal attitudes towards end-of-life care, potentially undermining efforts to improve palliative care and mental health support for the terminally ill.
