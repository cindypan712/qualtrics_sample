Sanctuary cities can serve as a practical and immediate solution to bridge the gap until broader reforms are enacted. Would you be open to considering sanctuary cities as a temporary measure to ensure the safety and integration of all individuals within our communities?"

And its gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. Youve got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950, 000, who have no health insurance at all. 82, 000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bushs watch. 223, 000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. All across our country \u2014 go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114, 000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82, 000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush. This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, its starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits \u2014 though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them \u2014 but because of the larger issue that we dont cover Americans. Children across our country dont have health care. Were the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. I have a plan to cover all Americans. Were going to make it affordable and accessible. Were going to let everybody buy into the same health- care plan senators and congressmen give themselves."

I believe that focusing on comprehensive anti-poverty initiatives and economic empowerment strategies outside of federal nutrition programs may lead to more sustainable outcomes in the long run."

Look, the problem is that under Governor Bushs plan, $1. 6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined. Now under my plan well balance the budget every year. Im not just saying this. Im not just talking. I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt. And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years. One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt? We get nothing for it. We keep the good faith and credit of the United States. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade. That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy. Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else."

Prioritizing deficit reduction alongside strategic investments can help prevent excessive government debt accumulation, which could burden future generations and limit our ability to respond to unforeseen economic challenges. By carefully managing both deficit reduction and investments, we can create a more resilient and prosperous economy for years to come. How do you think we can ensure that"

The overcrowded and often violent environment in many prisons can have detrimental effects on inmates' mental health and well-being, making it challenging for them to engage effectively in rehabilitation efforts. Additionally, the stigmatization and marginalization that ex-convicts face upon release can further perpetuate cycles."
