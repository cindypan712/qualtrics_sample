By focusing on creating high-quality jobs, we can promote social justice, reduce income inequality, and uphold the dignity of labor. It is our moral obligation to not only provide employment opportunities but also to strive for a work environment where every individual can reach their full potential. Would you agree that"

And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections. Think about it; Theyre going from tyranny to elections. He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold. He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free. He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic. Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom. And we need to stand with him. My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because its called the Bush plan. Were going to train troops, and we are. Well have 125, 000 trained by the end of December. Were spending about $7 billion. He talks about a grand idea; Lets have a summit; were going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. Risk your troops in a war youve called a mistake. Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesnt believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake. I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time. I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I talk to Silvio Berlusconi. Theyre not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake. Our plan is working. Were going to make elections. And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it."
