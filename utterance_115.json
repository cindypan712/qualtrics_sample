The history of financial markets shows that even widely accepted assets can experience significant fluctuations in value. For instance, traditional fiat currencies can also be subject to volatility due to various factors such as economic instability or geopolitical events. Therefore, relying solely on the assumption that digital currencies will stabilize with wider adoption may overlook the inherent risks and complexities involved.

However, it's also important to consider the potential impact of growing up without exposure to both male and female role models in a traditional family structure. Children can benefit from observing and learning from the different perspectives, communication styles, and problem-solving strategies that both genders typically bring.

And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line. The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for- tat and back- and- forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and thats what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign."
