I think we can find other ways for individuals to connect with nature and contribute to conservation efforts without resorting to hunting. By promoting non-lethal methods and conservation practices, we can achieve a more harmonious relationship with wildlife and nature as a whole."

There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got \u2014 who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. And the \u201cLos Angeles Times\u201d spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is the year \u2014 this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy."

It is able to accommodate a large number of offenders, which is a logistical necessity given the current crime rates. Additionally, it's a system that has been in place for a long time, and changing it would require significant resources and time. Therefore, until a more efficient alternative is available, the current system remains a practical solution."

Numerous studies have demonstrated that strategic investment in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure can lead to long-term economic growth without causing significant inflationary pressures. By carefully planning and monitoring government spending, it's possible to reap the benefits of increased public services without compromising economic stability."

The inherent drive for profit maximization can lead to unethical practices, such as exploitation of workers, environmental degradation, and prioritizing short-term gains over long-term sustainability. A truly ethical economic system should prioritize the well-being of all individuals and ensure that wealth and resources are distributed fairly, rather than concentrating power and resources in the hands of a few.

Im running to get some things done for America. Theres too many issues left unresolved. Theres been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D. C. I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in todays military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure theyre housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because its been a political issue. Its time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security. Its an important priority, because now is the time to act and were going to say to our seniors, our promises weve made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I dont believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. Thank you for listening. Im asking for your vote, and God bless."
