While exposure to different viewpoints is valuable, it's essential to maintain the integrity of scientific education by focusing on evidence-based theories. By incorporating creationism into educational curricula, we risk diluting the emphasis on empirical evidence and promoting faith-based beliefs as equal to scientific facts."

The costs associated with supplying birth control can be high, and the responsibility of funding it isn't clear. Additionally, making birth control widely accessible may lead to an increase in risky sexual behaviors due to the perceived safety net. So, it's important to consider all aspects when discussing this topic."

While intervention programs play a crucial role in providing immediate support, investing solely in these programs may not address the root causes of addiction or prevent future crises.
