Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? Whos the person who has believed that the best thing for America is \u2014 is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And Ive fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Lets give every American a choice; two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two \u2014 and let Americans choose whether they want the \u2014 the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42, 000 a year."

By turning our backs on refugees, we are essentially abandoning our moral principles and failing to uphold the values of compassion and solidarity. Yes, finding peaceful resolutions to conflicts is crucial, but in the meantime, we can't ignore the immediate needs of those who are suffering. We have the capacity to welcome refugees while also ensuring the safety of our communities through thorough screening processes and integration programs. Let's not lose sight"
