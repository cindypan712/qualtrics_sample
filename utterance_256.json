Their Department of Health reported that since the law's inception, over 90% of the patients who chose medical aid in dying were in hospice care, indicating severe, end-stage illnesses. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of Medical Ethics found that the quality of end-of-life care significantly improved in Oregon after the law was passed."

However, we must also acknowledge the deep-rooted inequalities that persist in our society. Affirmative action is a tool to address these disparities and create a more inclusive environment where everyone has a chance to succeed. It's about breaking down barriers and ensuring that individuals from all backgrounds are given a fair opportunity to showcase their talents and contribute meaning"

But that doesnt mean it wasnt a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden. It was. Now, we can succeed. But I dont believe this president can. I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do whats necessary to make it so America isnt doing this alone."
