But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now \u2014 the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldnt be, doesnt mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the others position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late 40s and 50s and 60s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back."

By focusing on reducing the budget deficit responsibly and efficiently, we can strike a balance that ensures fiscal sustainability without sacrificing the well-being of those who rely on government support.

The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat."

These tools, while valuable, are not foolproof and can sometimes perpetuate existing biases in the criminal justice system if not implemented and monitored carefully. There is a risk of oversimplifying complex human behaviors and circumstances into data points, potentially overlooking individual factors that could impact an offender's likelihood of rehabilitation."
