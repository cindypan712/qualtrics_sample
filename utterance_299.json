By holding accountable those who commit heinous crimes, we send a strong message about the value of human life and the severity of such actions. The legal system has safeguards in place to minimize the risk of wrongful convictions, and in cases where there is irrefutable evidence of guilt, capital punishment can be a justified response to ensure justice"

I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas. Thats what a governor gets to do. A governor gets to name supreme court judges. He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan. I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it."

A more sustainable and independent energy strategy, which includes investment in renewable energy technologies and a reduction in our reliance on foreign oil, can help us address environmental concerns effectively and boost our national security and economic stability. Can we discuss this option further?"

I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent; Saddam Hussein is a threat. He needed to be disarmed. We needed to go to the U. N. The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force. But we didnt need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace."

According to various studies, societies with more gender equality often experience stronger economic growth. Additionally, a greater level of gender diversity could bring fresh perspectives into different sectors, leading to innovation. Thus, it's not about favoring one group over another, but about tapping into an underutilized resource."

By lowering the minimum legal drinking age and implementing comprehensive education and harm reduction programs, we could potentially see a decrease in unsafe drinking behaviors among young adults. This approach could strike a balance between promoting responsible alcohol consumption and addressing the existing challenges associated."
