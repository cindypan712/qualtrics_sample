C. by 2, 000 slots. That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain. So if we are going to be serious about this issue, weve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head- on. And thats what I intend to do as president."

The environmental and ethical issues associated with this practice cannot be overlooked or easily mitigated through regulations and sustainable practices alone. The negative impacts on the environment, animal welfare, and human health are significant and require more fundamental changes to our food production system. Transitioning towards more sustainable and humane farming methods, such as agroecology and regenerative agriculture, can"
