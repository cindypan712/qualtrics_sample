Their Department of Health reported that since the law's inception, over 90% of the patients who chose medical aid in dying were in hospice care, indicating severe, end-stage illnesses. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of Medical Ethics found that the quality of end-of-life care significantly improved in Oregon after the law was passed."

And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \u201cGo out and shop. \u201d That wasnt the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so its important to understand that the \u2014 I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And lets take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. Were going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that theyre not using, that either you use them or you lose them. Were going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that were providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car thats made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And thats going to require effort from each and every one of us. And the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and thats one of the reasons why Im interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America. Thats something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington."

While advocating for fair trade practices and sustainable development is commendable, the reality is that structural inequalities and power imbalances persist within international trade agreements.

But envision a world where we suffocate mass media, where we shackle the free exchange of ideas and information. Isn't that a chilling thought too? Imagine the frustration, the desperation of a society deprived of its primary source of information. Instead, let's kindle hope and courage in our hearts to face the challenges of the media landscape. Let's foster"

Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do. Thirdly, spread whats called health savings accounts. Its good for small businesses, good for owners. You own your own account. You can save tax- free. You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it. This is different from saying, \u201cok, let me incent you to go on the government. \u201d Hes talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep \u2014 stop outsourcing. Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it wont work. The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan. I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal \u2014 to use coal and gas. It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel. Its stuck in the Senate. He and his running- mate didnt show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate. Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and weve got to keep taxes low. Now, he says hes only going to tax the rich. Do you realize, 900, 000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level. And so when youre running up the taxes like that, youre taxing job creators, and thats not how you keep jobs here."

Furthermore, a survey conducted by Pew Research Center found that 65% of adults in countries where religion and politics are intertwined reported high"

It's not about causing harm, but about teaching consequences. When used correctly, it's a powerful deterrent that instills a deep respect for rules and boundaries. We can still nurture their emotional well-being while also teaching them that actions have repercussions. This in no way encourages aggression, but rather, it helps children understand the importance of discipline and responsibility."
