I raise the child- care credit by $1, 000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids. I have a $4, 000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents \u2014 and kids, if theyre earning for themselves \u2014 to be able to pay for college. And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you. Every part of my program Ive shown how Im going to pay for it. And Ive gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work. Ive even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child- care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the presidents deficit keeps growing and Ive said as a pledge, \u201cIm going to cut the deficit in half in four years. \u201d Now, Im going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen; pay as you go. Were going to do it like you do it. The president broke the pay- as- you- go rule. Somebody here asked the question about, \u201cWhy havent you vetoed something? \u201d Its a good question. If you care about it, why dont you veto it? I think John McCain called the energy bill the \u201cNo Lobbyist Left Behind\u201d bill. I mean, youve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks. Im pledging I will not raise taxes; Im giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200, 000 a year. Now, for the people earning more than $200, 000 a year, youre going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money. And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected; the president, me, and, Charlie, Im sorry, you too. (LAUGHTER)"

In cases of genocide, terrorism, or aggression, a well-equipped and trained military is crucial in swiftly and effectively addressing these threats. By expanding the US Armed Forces, we can better respond to crises and prevent atrocities, ultimately serving the greater good by safeguarding human rights and promoting stability.

For instance, uniforms may not be comfortable for all students, potentially hindering their ability to concentrate in class. Furthermore, the enforcement of a uniform policy could require additional resources from schools, which could be better utilized in enhancing the educational facilities or programs. Hence, not having school uniforms seems to be a more practical approach."

There are other means, such as documentaries, educational programs, and advocacy campaigns, that can effectively highlight these issues without subjecting individuals to graphic and distressing content in real-time. It is essential to find more responsible and compassionate ways to address violence in society without resorting to broadcasting such harmful content."

Strengthening ties could lead to increased reliance on Mexico for certain goods and services. This could pose a risk to the US economy in the event of any instability or changes in Mexico's political or economic landscape. We need to ensure that our actions don't inadvertently make the US more vulnerable to external factors."

The inherent risks and uncertainties involved in hunting activities, coupled with the ethical considerations of taking animal lives for recreational purposes, warrant a cautious approach. Given the intrinsic value of wildlife and the interconnectedness of species within ecosystems, prioritizing non-lethal methods of hunting may be crucial."

In recent years, there have been numerous instances where misleading information spread through mass media channels, leading to confusion and division within society. Research has shown that false news stories spread six times faster on social media than true stories, highlighting the dangers of unverified information being disseminated widely. By limiting mass media to reputable sources and promoting fact-checking mechanisms,"

I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies. And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.
