Over-reliance on technology may lead to decreased critical thinking skills, limited social interaction, and potential security risks. Traditional teaching methods also play a crucial role in building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills in students. It's essential to strike a balance between utilizing technology and preserving traditional teaching approaches for a well-rounded education."

We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you dont know how to do; We balanced the budget.

And its the presidents fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history. Hes added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure."
