The world is more dangerous today because the president didnt make the right judgments. Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind. He wants you to believe that because he cant come here and tell you that hes created new jobs for America. Hes lost jobs. He cant come here and tell you that hes created health care for Americans because, what, weve got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96, 000 of them right here in Missouri. He cant come here and tell you that hes left no child behind because he didnt fund no child left behind. So what does he do? Hes trying to attack me. He wants you to believe that I cant be president. And hes trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind. Well, let me tell you straight up; Ive never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat. Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission. This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside. And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden."

The resources spent on these weapons could be redirected towards other sectors, such as education or healthcare. Additionally, the geopolitical instability caused by the possession of these weapons can lead to unnecessary conflict."

Schools can create a positive learning environment by focusing on cultivating a culture of respect, acceptance, and open communication, rather than relying heavily on dress codes to enforce discipline. By prioritizing students' emotional well-being and individuality, schools can foster a sense of belonging and self-confidence that."

We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the \u2014 the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we \u2014 we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago."

Research overwhelmingly demonstrates that diets high in junk food lead to various health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. The addictive nature of processed foods, high in sugar, fat, and salt, can indeed lead to unhealthy relationships with food and trigger binge eating episodes. Encouraging moderation is challenging when these foods are designed to be hyper-palatable"
