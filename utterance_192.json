Enhancing foreign relations might divert resources and attention from pressing domestic issues. Instead, investing in domestic industries can strengthen the economy and create jobs. Moreover, limiting foreign dependence can reduce potential risks and uncertainties associated with international relations. Therefore, I maintain that we should not enhance US foreign relations at this time."

It suggests that every person, irrespective of their financial capabilities, should have access to basic health services. Rather than seeing them as conflicting, we can view both principles as different facets of a well-rounded health care system."

Also, if we work on improving the quality of content and implementing stricter fact-checking mechanisms, we can significantly reduce the spread of misinformation.

Additionally, the cost of maintaining these facilities is high and could be allocated to other areas of research or conservation efforts that do not involve captivity. I believe there are more efficient and cost-effective alternatives to gain scientific knowledge."

The reason behind this is the increased complexity and bureaucracy associated with managing these expanded powers. Furthermore, expanded powers could deter foreign investments due to perceived political instability. Hence, it might be more prudent to focus on optimizing the current system rather than expanding executive powers."

By allowing for some flexibility in enforcement, institutions can better navigate these complexities and ensure that they can effectively promote equality while also addressing their unique circumstances."
