Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man. If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle- class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you. And you asked a great question because its not only seniors. Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies. They do some great things. They discover great new cures and thats great. We want them to continue that. But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion. You see all these ads? Than they are on research and development. And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices. I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and heres how it works. You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If youre poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4, 000 out- of- pocket. And Ill bring new competition to bring the price down. And if you pass the big drug companies bill, nothing will happen."

Socioeconomic factors, mental health issues, and cultural influences also play significant roles in shaping patterns of violence. Therefore, a more holistic approach that includes addressing these underlying factors alongside any potential legislative changes may be more effective in combating gun violence in our society."

By opening up trade barriers, we can access new markets, increase efficiency through specialization, and attract foreign investment. This can lead to economic growth, job creation, and overall prosperity for the country. What are your thoughts on this perspective?"

This separation is crucial in upholding the principle of religious freedom, where individuals have the right to practice any religion or none at all without fear of discrimination. By keeping religion separate from government affairs, it prevents the potential for religious bias in policymaking and protects the rights of minority religious groups. This approach fosters a more diverse and tolerant society where individuals are free to express their"

One significant issue is the impact on domestic industries and employment. When countries open their markets to free trade, they may be exposed to competition from foreign companies that can produce goods at lower costs due to differences in labor standards or environmental regulations. This can lead to job losses and economic dislocation in certain sectors, which can have detrimental effects on local."
