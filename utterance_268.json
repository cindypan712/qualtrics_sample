By uplifting those most affected by corruption, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society. It's essential to strike a balance and address various issues to build a better future for all."

A few years ago when he came to office, the president said \u2014 these are his words \u2014 \u201cWhat we need are some good conservative judges on the courts. \u201d And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. So you get a pretty good sense of where hes heading if he were to appoint somebody. Now, heres what I believe. I dont believe we need a good conservative judge, and I dont believe we need a good liberal judge. I dont believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side. I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard. He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when youre reading their decision, their opinion, you cant tell if its written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian. You just know youre reading a good judicial decision. What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it \u2014 and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen. The future of things that matter to you \u2014 in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department youll have, whether well enforce the law. Will we have equal opportunity? Will womens rights be protected? Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards? Will a womans right to choose be protected? These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law."

A more unified system could also streamline resources, potentially making education more efficient nationwide. Also, reform could take into account the evolution of technology and its role in education, preparing students better for the future job market."

It's a complex issue where we need to balance compassion for animals with the practicality of feeding a growing population. Emotions are important, but we must also take into account the harsh reality of food production on a large scale."

Overusing these powers can undermine the rule of law and the principle of accountability. It is crucial to ensure that those who have committed serious offenses face the consequences of their actions to uphold justice and deter future wrongdoing. Granting pardons too liberally could send the wrong message to society and weaken the deterrent effect of the legal system."

If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States. Thats not a grand coalition. Ninety percent of the casualties are American. Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets. I could do a better job. My plan does a better job. And thats why Ill be a better commander in chief."
