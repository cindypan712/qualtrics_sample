And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts. And I agree, it works extremely well now. On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, hes a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects. I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world- wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euros value has been dropping, but seems to be under control. But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie- breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever. But its not good enough. My attitude is you aint seen nothing yet. We need to do more and better."

It's essential for individuals, especially students, to prioritize their academic responsibilities and engage in a variety of activities to promote holistic development. However, it's also worth noting that not all gaming experiences are detrimental to academic performance.

Im asking you to see me for who I really am. Im offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals. And incidentally, one of them is this. This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party. And thats one of the reasons Ive said before, and Ill pledge here tonight, if Im president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain- Feingold campaign finance reform bill. And the reason its that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patients bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people. And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain- Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill."

It is about drawing upon the ethical teachings and principles that are shared among various religions to guide decision-making in a way that benefits society as a whole. By incorporating moral values that promote fairness, justice, and compassion from different religious traditions, we can create a more holistic approach to governance that respects diversity while upholding a common ethical framework."
