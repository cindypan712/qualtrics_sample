By offering them access to essential services, we can empower them to become productive members of society, contributing to the economy and overall well-being of the community. Moreover, addressing the needs of all children, regardless of their immigration status, aligns with principles of equality and human rights."

And thats why the FDA and thats why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way. Ive got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you. And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like its from Canada, and it might be from a third world. And weve just got to make sure, before somebody thinks theyre buying a product, that it works. And thats why were doing what were doing. Now, it may very well be here in December youll hear me say, I think theres a safe way to do it. There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper. One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand \u2014 brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And were doing just that. Another is to pass \u2014 to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and theyre working. Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1. 14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense. And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare. Because I went to Washington to fix problems. Medicare \u2014 the issue of Medicare used to be called \u201cMediscare. \u201d People didnt want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically. I wanted to get something done. I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system. And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage. Thank you for asking."

It may create an imbalance, and other nations might perceive it negatively. Yes, strong alliances can support broader diplomatic efforts, but it's equally important not to overlook the potential of new partnerships by focusing too much on strengthening existing ones."

Pardons and commutations provide immediate relief to individuals who may not have been reached by broader systemic reforms yet. By utilizing presidential clemency powers, urgent cases of injustice can be addressed, while systemic reforms prevent future injustices. This dual approach creates a more comprehensive and impactful strategy to promote fairness and equity within the justice system."

It's essential to carefully weigh the potential cost savings against the financial burden of expanding coverage to a larger population. Additionally, we must consider the potential implications on healthcare providers and their ability to meet the increased demand for services. It's crucial to ensure that any expansion of Medicare is sustainable and does not inadvertently create new challenges for the healthcare system as a whole."

Instead of discarding merit as a criterion for college admissions, we should focus on expanding the definition of merit to encompass a wider range of qualities and experiences that students from diverse backgrounds can bring to a campus community. By promoting a more holistic view of merit, we can create a more inclusive and diverse environment."
