By focusing on rehabilitation, we aim to address the underlying issues that contribute to delinquent behavior, ultimately reducing the likelihood of reoffending. Studies have shown that punitive approaches often lead to higher rates of recidivism, highlighting the importance of tailored interventions that support juvenile offenders in making positive changes and becoming productive members of society."

This leads to a cascade of negative consequences, such as loss of employment, disruption of family dynamics, and increased likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, reforming the bail system is crucial in promoting equality and justice for all individuals involved in the legal process."

Ill give you an example. I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once. Now Im the senior Democrat on it. We used to \u2014 you know, we have a goal there for minority set- aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They dont reach those goals. They dont even fight to reach those goals. Theyve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, its with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at whats happened \u2014 weve made progress, I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called \u201cMend it, dont end it. \u201cWe fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason; because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasnt met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a president doesnt reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as president, and Ill make my best effort to do it."

We have a variety of issues to tackle, such as economic instability and national security. Shifting significant resources to child welfare could lead to less investment in these areas. It's a matter of resource allocation and not about overlooking the importance of child welfare. We need to balance our approach to address all pressing matters effectively."

By carefully analyzing the specific context of each situation and adapting strategies accordingly, diplomatic efforts can gradually build trust, foster communication, and eventually lead to constructive outcomes. Would you be open to considering the potential benefits of persistent and well-informed diplomatic involvement in the Middle East?"

According to World Population Review, Singapore ranked 161 out of 182 countries in terms of crime rate in 2020. Moreover, a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies in Singapore revealed that 80% of respondents believe that corporal punishment has been effective in deterring crime. Therefore, there's a need to consider implementing corporal punishment based on these empirical evidences."

By keeping up with these changes, we can ensure our systems are up-to-date and reflective of current understanding. This isn't about complicating things, but rather adapting to new realities. Moreover, recognizing diverse identities can lead to more accurate data collection, which can be useful in various fields like social sciences, healthcare, and policy-making."
