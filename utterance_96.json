Investing in crime prevention measures, improving mental health support, and focusing on rehabilitation can also address the root causes of crime while promoting healing and justice in our society."

Capital punishment has been a part of human society's legal systems for centuries, serving as a testament to its perceived validity and effectiveness. It is deeply ingrained in our sense of justice and order."

What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4, 000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when Im president of the United States."

Once surveillance practices are expanded, there is a risk of mission creep, where initial intentions may evolve into broader monitoring beyond the original scope. This can lead to a slippery slope of encroaching on individual freedoms and privacy without clear boundaries. It's essential to carefully weigh the potential benefits of surveillance against the fundamental values of a free and open society."

According to a report by Statista, the number of blockchain wallet users worldwide has reached over 50 million in June 2020, a significant increase from 2016 when there were only around 10 million. In a study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, it was estimated that there were up to 5.8 million active users of cryptocurrency wallets. This increasing trend suggests that there's a growing acceptance."

Studies have indicated high rates of recidivism, suggesting that incarceration may not always rehabilitate individuals effectively. Moreover, the system disproportionately affects marginalized communities, leading to issues of systemic injustice and inequality. Alternative models, such as restorative justice programs, have shown success in reducing reoffending rates and promoting rehabilitation. Therefore, it's crucial to consider these empirical findings when discussing the effectiveness of the prison system"

And if you make less than $250, 000, less than a quarter- million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem; There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5, 000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5, 000 tax credit. Heres the only problem; Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be."

This isn't just a theoretical concept, but a fundamental element of our democratic process. The idea of expanding executive powers doesn't align with this design. It's not about mistrust, it's about adhering to the democratic principles we have in place."
