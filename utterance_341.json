Yes, homeschooling may foster a love for knowledge, but being in a conventional school setting allows students to understand and appreciate a symphony of different perspectives. They learn to navigate a world shaped by diverse minds and hearts. The shared laughter, tears, dreams, and heartaches are integral parts of personal growth. Can"

This is not related to potential implications, but based on a principle that the law should be interpreted as it is written. It is the job of the legislature to write laws and the judiciary to interpret them, not to enact changes."

Now, maybe that explains why he hasnt fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining. Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare. He doesnt adequately fund it. But let me just say to America; I am not proposing a government- run program. Thats not what I have. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Senators and congressmen have a wide choice. Americans ought to have it too."

While it is important to address the unique circumstances of different regions, we must do so in a way that upholds the core principles of democracy and ensures equal representation for all individuals. By prioritizing transparency, accountability, and fairness in our electoral processes, we can better serve the needs of diverse communities without resorting to tactics that can undermine the integrity of our political system."

But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and thats what Im talking about. But let me just address what the president just said. Ladies and gentlemen, thats just not true what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and hes counted as a small business. Dick Cheneys counted as a small business. Thats how they do things. Thats just not right."
