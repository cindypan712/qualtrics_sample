I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that thats the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that theyre too weak to do it, but thats what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governors not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, Im told, except for three where they notified, and theyre trying to break out of the box, theres no question about it. I dont think they should be allowed to."

By limiting mass media, we can protect society from being misled and exploited for ulterior motives. It's crucial to prioritize the truth and safeguard the well-being of our communities, even if it means sacrificing some of the conveniences that mass media provides."

It presents an opportunity for countries to exchange their unique offerings, thereby enriching the global marketplace. This doesn't mean they lose their national identity, rather it's an enhancement of diversity and choice."

It is crucial to consider the rights and well-being of both."

However, an effective executive can delegate tasks and solicit diverse inputs while maintaining the ability for swift decision-making. Furthermore, expanding powers doesn't mean discarding collective decision-making. Instead, it can enhance it by streamlining the process, cutting red tape, and enabling quicker implementation of those collective decisions."
