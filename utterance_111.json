The inherent risks and uncertainties involved in hunting activities, coupled with the ethical considerations of taking animal lives for recreational purposes, warrant a cautious approach. Given the intrinsic value of wildlife and the interconnectedness of species within ecosystems, prioritizing non-lethal methods of hunting may be crucial."

By integrating stable housing with targeted interventions for mental health, addiction, and employment, we can create a more holistic system that meets the diverse needs of individuals experiencing homelessness. This combined approach can offer the necessary support and resources for individuals to not only secure housing but also work towards long-lasting stability and well-being. It's important to address both housing and support services simultaneously to create sustainable solutions for the homeless"

The fact is that my health- care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I dont force you to do anything. Its not a government plan. The government doesnt require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you dont want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you dont have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co- pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan. And I dont think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Heres what I do; We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to \u2014 theyre not forced to, they can choose to \u2014 they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. Its their choice. I think theyll choose it, because its a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow you \u2014 if you choose to, you dont have to \u2014 but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If its good enough for us, its good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, were going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether theyre self- employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that \u2014 for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And Im going to offer it to America."
