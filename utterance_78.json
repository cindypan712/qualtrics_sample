While seeking unity and collaboration is important, we cannot compromise on the fundamental values that uphold our democracy. By taking a principled stand on matters of ethical importance, we not only ensure the integrity of our institutions but also set a precedent for future leaders to adhere to the highest."

It's essential to explore alternative approaches that can achieve the goal of improving healthcare access without compromising on efficiency, innovation, and individual choice in healthcare decision-making. We should carefully evaluate the potential trade-offs and implications of different policy options before making a decision on expanding Medicare access."

And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise well be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude."

It is important to proceed with caution and carefully evaluate the potential impact of any proposed changes before implementing them. By taking a measured approach, we can better assess which reforms are truly effective and in the best interest of all involved."

She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U. S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \u201cmuddle through\u201d Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban. I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when Im president, I will."

Imagine the despair of a mother unable to feed her starving child, or the silent tears of a homeless veteran neglected by society. It's not that I dismiss the pain of anti-LGBTQ+ victims, but the world is filled with so many other tortured souls who also need us. Can we afford to prioritize one group's suffering over another's?"

By holding accountable those who commit heinous crimes, we send a strong message about the value of human life and the severity of such actions. The legal system has safeguards in place to minimize the risk of wrongful convictions, and in cases where there is irrefutable evidence of guilt, capital punishment can be a justified response to ensure justice"
