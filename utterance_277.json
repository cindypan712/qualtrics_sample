However, a report by the Migration Policy Institute indicates that the majority of children born to immigrant parents in the U.S. have parents who are legally present, and these children often grow up to be productive members of society. Therefore, addressing \"birth tourism\" specifically, instead of eliminating birthright citizenship, could be a more balanced approach."

I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington."

Upholding the rule of law and discouraging illegal immigration is essential for ensuring fairness and justice for all individuals, including those who are following legal immigration processes."

While both play important roles in society, intertwining the two can lead to division, discrimination, and the imposition of beliefs on individuals who may not share them. A government should remain neutral in matters of religion to ensure equal treatment for all citizens. By keeping politics and religion separate, we can create a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their own faith without interference."

However, eradicating anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, bullying, and violence can have a significant positive impact on society as a whole. When individuals from the LGBTQ+ community face discrimination and violence, it not only harms them directly but also perpetuates a culture of intolerance and injustice. By combatting these issues, we can promote equality, respect, and acceptance for all individuals, leading to a more harmonious and inclusive"
