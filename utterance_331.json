While holding the powerful accountable is crucial for a functioning democracy, we must be mindful of the methods we use to achieve this end. Reckless actions, such as indiscriminate data dumps, can have far-reaching and detrimental consequences that may outweigh the benefits of exposing the truth.

I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who. I think we need to fully enforce the law. I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, well enforce it. Be strict and firm about it."

The potential benefits you mention, like extending and improving lives, could indeed be revolutionary.
