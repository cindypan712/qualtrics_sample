While some ethical productions exist, they are overshadowed by harmful content perpetuating damaging stereotypes and behaviors. Allowing this proliferation risks normalizing exploitation and violence as acceptable sexuality expressions. Prioritizing individuals' well-being and safety over the dissemination of potentially harmful material is essential."

Ill give you an example. I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once. Now Im the senior Democrat on it. We used to \u2014 you know, we have a goal there for minority set- aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They dont reach those goals. They dont even fight to reach those goals. Theyve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, its with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at whats happened \u2014 weve made progress, I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called \u201cMend it, dont end it. \u201cWe fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason; because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasnt met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a president doesnt reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as president, and Ill make my best effort to do it."

For instance, biofuel production can incentivize the use of marginal lands that are unsuitable for food crops, thereby reducing the pressure on prime agricultural land. Additionally, research has shown that integrated farming systems, where biofuel crops are grown alongside food crops, can increase overall land productivity and contribute to food"
