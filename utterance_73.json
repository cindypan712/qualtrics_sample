However, isn't it equally our moral duty to ensure the safety and stability of our current citizens? Yes, showing empathy and compassion is important but this does not necessarily mean we have to welcome all refugees. We can provide support in their native countries. Plus, the sudden influx of refugees could lead to social unrest and economic instability. Shouldn't we prioritize finding peaceful resolutions to the conflicts causing these crises?"

It is a highly personal decision that should be left to individuals to make without influence or pressure from society or any promotional campaigns. It's a matter of respecting individual choices and personal boundaries."

For instance, uniforms may not be comfortable for all students, potentially hindering their ability to concentrate in class. Furthermore, the enforcement of a uniform policy could require additional resources from schools, which could be better utilized in enhancing the educational facilities or programs. Hence, not having school uniforms seems to be a more practical approach."

If every media outlet is resorting to violence for shock value, it limits the diversity of content on offer. Regulation could encourage more creativity in storytelling, leading to a more vibrant and diverse media landscape. Moreover, regulations could help media outlets better cater to their audience's preferences, as not all viewers are comfortable with high levels of violence."
