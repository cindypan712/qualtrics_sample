General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom. I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We dont want our kids coming back here. And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq."

Factory farming, despite its challenges, has been able to provide a significant portion of the world's food supply due to its high productivity and cost-effectiveness. By supporting and improving factory farming practices, we can ensure food security for a larger population more sustainably."

Sometimes, certain limitations on these liberties are necessary to ensure the well-being and safety of the community as a whole. Upholding the common good and maintaining order can sometimes require restricting individual freedoms. It is crucial to strike a balance between protecting civil liberties and upholding societal values to promote a harmonious and stable environment for everyone."

Providing education and healthcare to this specific group can create challenges in terms of funding and resource distribution. It's crucial to strike a balance between compassion and practicality to ensure that the needs of both citizens and immigrants are met without overburdening the system. By carefully assessing the impact of such policies, we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable solution"

Decriminalizing prostitution doesn't align with my moral values, as I believe that intimate acts should not be commoditized. This is not about the potential effects of decriminalization, but rather, a fundamental disagreement on the nature of sex work itself."
