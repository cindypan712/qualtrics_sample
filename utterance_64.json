But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now \u2014 the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldnt be, doesnt mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the others position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late 40s and 50s and 60s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back."

Instead of focusing solely on corporate corruption, we should broaden our efforts to include other pressing matters. This isn't to say corporate corruption isn't significant, but rather that our attention should not be confined to it. It's about having a multifaceted approach to addressing societal challenges."

It's worth considering how a reformed K12 education system could better prepare students for the future. Would you be open to exploring the potential benefits of some carefully thought-out changes?"

By combining various strategies, including comprehensive gun control measures, we can create a more robust system that addresses the multifaceted nature of violence prevention. It's about utilizing a combination of approaches to tackle the issue from different angles effectively."

By responsibly managing deforestation activities and implementing reforestation efforts, we can mitigate the negative impacts on the environment while still reaping the benefits of economic development.

Prioritizing their rights can lead to the cultivation of unique skills and knowledge inherent to these communities, thereby promoting diversity and innovation in various sectors. Furthermore, it can also lead to an increase in overall productivity and economic growth by integrating previously marginalized individuals into the labor market. This isn't about favoritism but tapping into an underutilized resource for the benefit of the nation's economy."
