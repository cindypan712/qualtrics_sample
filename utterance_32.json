And were not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology. We have iris- identification technology. We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today. We can know who the people are, that theyre really the people they say they are when they cross the border. We could speed it up. There are huge delays. The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and Ill make them secure."

Yet, my heart aches when I think of the countless individuals struggling with immediate crises today. I have seen the despair in their eyes, the hunger gnawing at their bellies, the fear that grips them as they wonder where their next meal will come from. The urgency of their plight is so palpable, it drowns out all else."

Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and thats exactly what Im talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the president and me. And there, again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is \u2014 one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today; people with stop- loss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But Ill tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, Id be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda. Its a moral responsibility for us and the world."
