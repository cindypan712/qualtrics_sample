A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that specialized policies often lead to an uneven distribution of resources. In fact, 60% of all federal aid targeted for marginalized demographics is concentrated on just 20% of the population. This includes Native Americans but leaves out other disadvantaged communities. Therefore, we must ensure a balanced approach that benefits all marginalized groups and not prioritize one over the other. Only"

Upholding the rule of law and discouraging illegal immigration is essential for ensuring fairness and justice for all individuals, including those who are following legal immigration processes."

The president \u2014 and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the presidents father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all \u2014 and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me. Why? Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president. Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty. Youve got people doing two and three rotations. Youve got stop- loss policies, so people cant get out when they were supposed to. Youve got a back- door draft right now. And a lot of our military are underpaid. These are families that get hurt. It hurts the middle class. It hurts communities, because these are our first responders. And theyre called up. And theyre over there, not over here. Now, Im going to add 40, 000 active duty forces to the military, and Im going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because Im going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others. Were going to build alliances. Were not going to go unilaterally. Were not going to go alone like this president did."

Additionally, the cost of maintaining these facilities is high and could be allocated to other areas of research or conservation efforts that do not involve captivity. I believe there are more efficient and cost-effective alternatives to gain scientific knowledge."

Gentrification often leads to the displacement of long-time residents, especially low-income families and minorities, as property values rise and they can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This can result in the loss of community ties, cultural heritage, and social cohesion. Additionally, the influx of wealthier residents can lead to increased cost of living, pushing out those who have"

Picture their faces as they come to understand that this isn't a stepping stone, but a trap.

By implementing stricter regulations and monitoring systems, we can deter misuse of the system while still upholding the fundamental value of inclusivity and equal opportunities for all individuals born within our borders. Abandoning birthright citizenship entirely could have far-reaching implications and erode the core principles of our society."
