For example, initiatives that promote inclusive growth, enhance social protection, and strengthen labor rights can help level the playing field and ensure that the gains from free trade are more equitably shared.

In a study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, it was estimated that there were up to 5.8 million active users of cryptocurrency wallets. This increasing trend suggests that there's a growing acceptance."

Allowing such drugs not only raises serious health concerns for the athletes themselves but also sets a dangerous precedent that success can be bought or artificially enhanced rather than earned through hard work and perseverance.
