Instead, it may result in a more complex and burdensome procedure, potentially discouraging voters. Moreover, these enhancements could require significant funding, which might be better allocated elsewhere. Therefore, it might be more beneficial to maintain our current voting laws and focus on other aspects of our political system."

The food environment plays a significant role in shaping dietary habits, and widespread encouragement of junk food consumption can contribute to the normalization of unhealthy eating patterns. By focusing on promoting whole, nutrient-dense foods and creating environments that support healthy choices, we can help shift societal norms towards better overall health and well-being."
