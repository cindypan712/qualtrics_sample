For instance, risk assessments have their own set of costs and challenges, such as the need for constant updating and potential bias in the algorithms used.

A well-prepared military not only serves as a deterrent to aggression but also provides the necessary capabilities to respond effectively to various threats, both domestic and international. By expanding the US Armed Forces, we can enhance our ability to protect our interests and allies, maintain stability in regions of conflict, and contribute to global peacekeeping efforts."
