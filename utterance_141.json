Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes of living organisms, which is a complex process with unpredictable outcomes. The scientific community is still grappling with understanding these processes fully. Therefore, it seems more prudent to focus on understanding these mechanisms thoroughly before moving forward with genetic engineering."

It's about fostering empathy and understanding for all individuals, which fills me with hope and determination to create a better world for everyone."

The credible threat of retaliation with such weapons can dissuade adversaries from initiating conflicts or attacks. It acts as a form of insurance, ensuring the protection of national security interests. In an unpredictable world, having this deterrent can help maintain stability and prevent adversaries from taking undue risks."
