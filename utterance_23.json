For instance, biofuel production can incentivize the use of marginal lands that are unsuitable for food crops, thereby reducing the pressure on prime agricultural land. Additionally, research has shown that integrated farming systems, where biofuel crops are grown alongside food crops, can increase overall land productivity and contribute to food"

This means that a significant portion of the country, including both urban and rural areas, may feel neglected regardless of the election process. By transitioning to a national popular vote, candidates would be incentivized to appeal to a broader range of voters across all regions, ultimately"
