People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy. That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me. I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government. That theyre appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred. They shouldnt misuse their bench. I dont believe in liberal activist judges. I believe in strict constructionists. Those are the kind of judges I will appoint. Ive named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations. Theyre good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas."

By encouraging students to engage in activism and express their opinions, educational institutions can foster a culture of intellectual curiosity, civic engagement, and social responsibility. When approached thoughtfully and in a structured manner, student activism can enhance the overall educational experience by encouraging students to apply their learning to real-world"
