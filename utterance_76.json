But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual. A supporter of Senator Obamas is Warren Buffett. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today. I like Meg Whitman, she knows what its like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1. 3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them. But the point is its going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we dont have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D. C."

Universal health insurance may lead to increased government involvement and higher taxes, which could have negative economic consequences. By promoting competition and innovation, we can potentially achieve better results without resorting to universal coverage."

He has more of the same. Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. Thats Allawis assessment. The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best- case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst- case scenario, civil war. I can do better."

Foods like beans, lentils, tofu, and quinoa are excellent sources of protein and other essential nutrients. By incorporating a variety of these foods into one's diet, it's possible to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle without relying on meat."

Implementing more stringent laws, such as ID checks, could require substantial resources. The costs associated with training staff, updating systems and facilities, and managing these processes could be significant. Additionally, these changes could potentially increase wait times at polling stations, leading to inefficiencies in the voting process."

By providing a legal framework for this practice, we can ensure that end-of-life choices are made with full awareness, respect for autonomy, and in consultation with healthcare professionals. This can lead to more open and honest conversations between patients, their families, and healthcare providers, fostering a sense of empowerment and dignity in navigating"

This normalization can make it easier for individuals to justify more frequent consumption of junk food, leading to potential health risks over time. Encouraging healthier food choices and alternatives can help individuals develop better eating habits and reduce the reliance on junk food for satisfaction. Therefore, discouraging the consumption of"
