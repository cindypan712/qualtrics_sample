If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in? If we couldve stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act. So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us."

If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps \u2014 the spending caps \u2014 over 200 times. And here he says hes going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. Its just not credible. You cannot believe it. And of course hes going to raise your taxes. You see, hes proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending. And you say; Well, how are you going to pay for it? He says, well, hes going to raise the taxes on the rich \u2014 thats what he said \u2014 the top two brackets. That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion. Weve got battling green eye shades. Somewhere in between those numbers \u2014 and so theres a difference, what hes promised and what he can raise. Now, either hes going to break all these wonderful promises hes told you about or hes going to raise taxes. And I suspect, given his record, hes going to raise taxes. Is my time up yet?"

While incremental changes may take longer to implement, they can allow for a more measured and controlled adjustment process that minimizes disruptions. It's essential to strike a balance between the desire for improvement and the need to maintain order and stability within the existing system."
