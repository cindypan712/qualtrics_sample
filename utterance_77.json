And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked \u2014 responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now. When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, \u201cAny place, any time, \u201d the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. And the fact is, its gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable. One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect \u2014 Ive written about him \u2014 Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful. And, Senator Obama, you didnt repudiate those remarks. Every time theres been an out- of- bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate. So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And its a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it. And, Senator Obama, when he said \u2014 and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did \u2014 that was back when he was a long- shot candidate \u2014 you didnt keep your word. And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, \u201cI will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision, \u201d you didnt tell the American people the truth because you didnt. And thats \u2014 thats \u2014 thats an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obamas campaign than any time since Watergate."

Instead, it may result in a more complex and burdensome procedure, potentially discouraging voters. Moreover, these enhancements could require significant funding, which might be better allocated elsewhere. Therefore, it might be more beneficial to maintain our current voting laws and focus on other aspects of our political system."
