While rehabilitation and restorative justice are valuable approaches, there are instances where immediate consequences are necessary to prevent further harm and maintain order.

Furthermore, job creation stimulates economic growth and can lead to increased consumer spending, which in turn creates a positive feedback loop for job growth. So, while it's not the only solution, job creation is a significant part of the equation."

The reason behind this is the increased complexity and bureaucracy associated with managing these expanded powers. Furthermore, expanded powers could deter foreign investments due to perceived political instability. Hence, it might be more prudent to focus on optimizing the current system rather than expanding executive powers."

Studies have shown that for about half of seniors, Social Security provides the majority of their income. Moreover, private savings and investment options may not be sufficient or accessible to all individuals, especially those with lower incomes or limited financial literacy. Enhancing Social Security alongside promoting personal savings can create a more inclusive and effective retirement system that addresses the needs of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status."
