By shifting towards more restorative and rehabilitative practices, we can create a more just and compassionate system that truly prioritizes the well-being and growth of all individuals involved."

And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were \u2014 we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to \u2014 to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go. And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well."

While immediate relief is crucial, we must also think about the broader implications of continuously bailing out individuals and businesses. By fostering a culture of self-reliance and encouraging responsible financial behavior, we can promote a society where individuals are empowered to overcome challenges independently, leading to a more sustainable and equitable future for all."

Heres some help for you to go to a community college. Weve expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. You know, theres a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. And so we said; Lets raise the standards. Were spending more money, but lets raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before its too late. No, education is how to help the person whos lost a job. Education is how to make sure weve got a workforce thats productive and competitive. Got four more years, Ive got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. And so the person you talked to, I say, heres some help, heres some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And thats what I would say to that person."

Furthermore, a study published in the Journal of Business Ethics found that companies addressing these issues along with corporate corruption resulted in better overall performance and stronger stakeholder relationships. Therefore, a comprehensive approach tackling these issues simultaneously can lead to a more ethical and resilient business environment."

Can we really risk our country's future, our children's future, by inviting the influence of a nation known for its lack of transparency and human rights abuses? It's like a chilling wind, making us shiver with fear and uncertainty. We must stand strong, protecting our values and the wellbeing of our people."
