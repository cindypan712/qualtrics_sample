I believe that a balance can be struck by implementing targeted reforms within the current system to address access and affordability issues without fully transitioning to a universal model."

It's about finding a comprehensive approach that considers the diverse needs of our society. Prioritizing child welfare programs should be part of a larger strategy that takes into account the well-being of all community members."

Broadening their use doesn't necessarily mean abusing the power, but rather opening up opportunities for more nuanced decisions. Instead of seeing them as a way to circumvent justice, we should see them as a way to humanize it."

However, isn't it equally our moral duty to ensure the safety and stability of our current citizens? Yes, showing empathy and compassion is important but this does not necessarily mean we have to welcome all refugees. We can provide support in their native countries. Plus, the sudden influx of refugees could lead to social unrest and economic instability. Shouldn't we prioritize finding peaceful resolutions to the conflicts causing these crises?"
