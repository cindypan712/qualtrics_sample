One crucial aspect to consider is the ethical implications surrounding AI, especially in terms of decision-making and privacy. The reliance on AI systems that are not thoroughly regulated or transparent can lead to unintended consequences, such as bias in algorithms or data breaches.

All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it."
