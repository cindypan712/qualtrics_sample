While intervention programs play a crucial role in providing immediate support, investing solely in these programs may not address the root causes of addiction or prevent future crises. By considering a combination of intervention, prevention, and treatment strategies, we can work towards a more sustainable and comprehensive solution to the opioid crisis.

Balancing our research focus across various fields could lead to a more holistic progress in science."

General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom. I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We dont want our kids coming back here. And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq."

This way, students will be more equipped to enter the workforce and contribute meaningfully to society."
