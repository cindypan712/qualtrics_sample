(LAUGHTER) I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law. I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States. Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldnt pick. I wouldnt pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldnt be said in a school because it had the words \u201cunder God\u201d in it. I think thats an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision- making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights. Thats a personal opinion. Thats not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says were all \u2014 you know, it doesnt say that. It doesnt speak to the equality of America. And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. Weve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D. C. Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution. And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year \u2014 the next four years. And thats the kind of judge Im going to put on there. No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution. Thank you."

Research from the Journal of Educational Research supports this by indicating that uniforms help reduce peer pressure related to clothing choices and decrease distractions in the classroom, leading to a more focused learning environment. By implementing a uniform policy in conjunction with initiatives promoting diversity and empathy, schools can potentially strike a balance that enhances both unity and individuality."
