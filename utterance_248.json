My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present- day workers that we are going \u2014 that present- day retirees have today. Were going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip ONeill. I know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. Thats my clear record. We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.

According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, unionized workers earn on average 13.2% more in wages than non-union workers with similar education, occupation, and experience. This suggests that unions are effective at securing better pay for their members. Beyond wages, a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 94% of union workers have access to job-related benefits like health insurance and retirement plans."
