N. and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And, unfortunately, he didnt go to war as a last resort. Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq \u2014 $200 billion. Its not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted."

By leveraging the bargaining power of a larger Medicare program, we can negotiate lower drug prices, streamline administrative processes, and implement cost-saving measures to ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system. This holistic approach will not only improve access to care but also tackle the root causes of high healthcare spending and disparities."

After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days wed see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. Thats why were bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. Thats why I said to Afghanistan; If you harbor a terrorist, youre just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil- for- food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason; He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. Thats why he called him a grave threat. I wasnt happy when we found out there wasnt weapons, and weve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponents plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir."
