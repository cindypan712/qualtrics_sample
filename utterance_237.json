The cause-and-effect relationship between committing heinous acts and facing capital punishment provides a sense of justice for the victims and their families. While rehabilitation is important, for certain crimes, the safety of society and the need for justice outweigh the potential risks. It serves as a powerful deterrent and ensures that individuals think twice before committing such atrocious acts."

While rehabilitation and restorative justice are valuable approaches, there are instances where immediate consequences are necessary to prevent further harm and maintain order. Striking a balance between accountability and compassion is crucial in promoting a just and safe society for everyone."

What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track."

It's a moral imperative to ensure that all individuals have access to necessary medical care, regardless of their financial situation. Healthcare is a fundamental human right, and by implementing universal health insurance, we can uphold the value of justice and promote the well-being of society as a whole. What are your thoughts on this?"

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand- new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right; Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way. And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it. \u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor. \u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain. \u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re- enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we dont want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated."

Research has shown that an overreliance on the Court to address complex social issues can lead to a democratic deficit by diminishing the role of other branches of government and public participation in decision-making processes. By distributing authority more evenly across branches and fostering a robust civic engagement, we can strengthen our democracy and ensure a more inclusive."
