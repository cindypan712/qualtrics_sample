Without the assurance of re-election, lawmakers may not invest in initiatives that take longer than their term to bear fruit. Moreover, term limits could also lead to a loss of experienced legislators who have a deep understanding of complex policy issues. This could negatively impact the quality of legislation."

By implementing comprehensive support measures for marginalized groups while promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for all, we can address structural inequalities effectively and sustainably.

He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7, 700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. Its an empty promise. Its called bait and switch."

All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile. And we cant do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States."
