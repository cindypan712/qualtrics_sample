        "text": "Jim, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening. Im running to get some things done for America. Theres too many issues left unresolved. Theres been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D. C. I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in todays military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure theyre housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because its been a political issue. Its time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security. Its an important priority, because now is the time to act and were going to say to our seniors, our promises weve made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I dont believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. Thank you for listening. Im asking for your vote, and God bless."

Not all believe that expanding Medicare is the best path forward for our healthcare system. There are other possibilities that don't involve expanding Medicare, and they deserve equal consideration."

By increasing funding for healthcare providers and facilities along with expanding Medicare coverage, we can mitigate the strain on the healthcare system. This investment will not only improve access to care but also create more job opportunities in the healthcare sector, addressing the issue of provider shortages. Ultimately, ensuring more people have access to Medicare can lead to a healthier population, reduced healthcare disparities, and a more sustainable healthcare system in the long term"

Studies have shown that countries that engage in global trade tend to have higher economic growth rates and lower levels of poverty. By participating in the global market, the US can access a wider range of products and services at competitive prices, benefiting both consumers and businesses. Additionally, globalization promotes technological advancements and knowledge transfer, which can drive innovation and productivity in domestic industries. It's crucial to strike a"

And if you make less than $250, 000, less than a quarter- million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem; There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5, 000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5, 000 tax credit. Heres the only problem; Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be."

While lessons from states can provide valuable insights, the dynamics and scale of the federal government differ significantly, warranting careful consideration of how term limits could impact the functioning of Congress as a whole. By weighing the empirical research on both sides of the argument and engaging in thorough deliberation, we can strive to develop a comprehensive approach that"

By fostering a supportive and non-judgmental environment, individuals are more likely to feel empowered to make positive changes for their health without the fear of stigma or shame. Embracing body diversity and promoting self-acceptance can actually encourage people to prioritize their health from a place of self-love rather than self."
