        "text": "Zero, because as I said in our last debate and Ill repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it. I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, weve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or theyre going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums. The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured. So heres what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, well give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. If you dont have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described. Now, what we havent talked about is Senator McCains plan. He says hes going to give you all a $5, 000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance. Heres the problem \u2014 that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer- based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5, 000, young and healthy folks. Older folks, less healthy folks, whats going to end up happening is that youre going to be the only ones left in your employer- based system, your employers wont be able to afford it. And once youre out on your own with this $5, 000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer. And this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing peoples health care benefits. By the way, the average policy costs about $12, 000. So if youve got $5, 000 and its going to cost you $12, 000, thats a loss for you. Last point about Senator McCains plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCains plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry- picking and excluding people from coverage. That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care."

Plus, early action can help us avoid the potentially higher costs of dealing with severe environmental damages and climatic shifts in the future. It's not about prioritizing one issue over another, but about working towards sustainability while also addressing other immediate challenges."

Trusting individuals to make decisions based on their well-being should be balanced with the moral duty to protect the rights of the unborn. It is crucial to explore alternatives and provide support that upholds the sanctity of life while addressing the needs of those in difficult situations. As a society, we should strive to find compassionate solutions that respect the dignity of all individuals involved."

By promoting neurodiversity, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for them. Instead of seeing their differences as burdens, we should celebrate the strengths and resilience they possess. With the right accommodations and acceptance, neurodiverse individuals can thrive and contribute in ways that benefit us all."

Ive been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old. And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment. But Ill tell you this. Im also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorneys offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. Ive broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They dont want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK- 47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, \u201cSee the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK- 47 lying on the bed right beside him. \u201cBecause of the presidents decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And thats what Osama bin Ladens handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. It encouraged them to do it. So I believe Americas less safe. If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, \u201cSorry, we dont have the votes, \u201d Id have said, \u201cThen were going to have a fight. \u201cAnd Id have taken it out to the country and Id have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen. Wed have won what Bill Clinton won."

Increased access to birth control could inadvertently contribute to a normalization of casual sex and a societal shift towards prioritizing individual desires over long-term commitments and relationships. This shift in values and attitudes towards sex could have profound implications for the institution of family and community structures, potentially eroding traditional values that have long served as the foundation of society"

Ultimately, a focus on rehabilitation not only benefits the offenders but also"
