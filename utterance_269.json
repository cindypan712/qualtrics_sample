There are other ways to champion progress, innovation, and fairness without necessarily involving additional spending. This is not about being against support for these values, but about being prudent and cautious when it comes to handling taxpayer money."

We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the \u2014 the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we \u2014 we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago."

The promise of opportunity and progress for all is often overshadowed by systemic inequalities and exploitation.

By being cautious with what we share and staying informed about privacy settings, we can still enjoy the creativity and connection Tik."

I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesnt make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close."

The accessibility and reliability of fossil fuels have allowed industries to grow, creating jobs and economic opportunities for many people. Without fossil fuels, our transportation systems, manufacturing processes, and electricity production would struggle to meet the demands of our modern world."
