We can't let screens replace genuine human connection and tangible action. Our world needs more than just online gestures to address complex issues effectively."

While addressing underreporting and creating a supportive environment for survivors are important goals, there are concerns about the impact of aggressive enforcement on the due process rights of the accused. Finding a balance that protects the rights of all individuals involved while effectively addressing sexual violence and discrimination is crucial. Exploring alternative approaches that can achieve these."

We must hold our leaders to the highest ethical standards, regardless of their position or power. It's our duty to ensure that those who abuse their authority are held responsible for their actions. What are your thoughts on this matter?"

This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means \u201cwithout preconditions. \u201d It doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, \u201cUntil you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you. \u201d Theres a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low- level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we havent done it, as in North Korea \u2014 let me just take one more example \u2014 in North Korea, we cut off talks. Theyre a member of the axis of evil. We cant deal with them. And you know what happened? They went \u2014 they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re- engaged \u2014 because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this \u2014 then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And \u2014 and I just \u2014 so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCains own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he \u2014 you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally."
