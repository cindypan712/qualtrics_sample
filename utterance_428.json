It is crucial to complement these tools with comprehensive evaluations that take into account the unique circumstances and needs of each individual. By incorporating a holistic approach that considers both quantitative data and qualitative factors, we can better tailor interventions to address the root causes of criminal behavior and support individuals in their rehabilitation journey. This balanced approach can help mitigate the risk of perpetuating biases while promoting fair and effective outcomes within the criminal justice system."
