While local decision-making can indeed lead to more responsive governance, we must also consider the potential negative consequences of allowing states to enact policies that undermine the core principles of justice and equality. Upholding a strong federal framework alongside states' rights is essential to safeguarding"

Embracing AI is not about achieving growth and innovation, but about acknowledging its potential. The combination of AI and human intelligence could form a dynamic duo. The future it leads us to might be unknown, but it certainly is a fascinating concept."

Let me tell you my position. I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people. But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety. None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles. Theyre aimed at the real problem. Lets make our schools safe, lets make our neighborhoods safe. Lets have a three- day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldnt have guns dont get them. But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago. Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, Im not. And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300, 000 people. And its now the smallest number that we have had since the \u2014 the smallest in size since John Kennedys administration. During the last five years, Texass government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down, Texass government has gone up. Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you dont have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster. We can do that."

The military should indeed value skills and dedication, but introducing elements that could potentially distract from the mission at hand might not be the best way forward. Can we be certain that this change will promote trust and respect, rather than introduce additional stressors? It's a delicate balance to maintain discipline and focus in such high-stakes environments."

The current system often leads to issues such as voter suppression, lack of representation for all voices, and the influence of money in politics. By reforming the process to make it more inclusive, transparent, and representative of the population, we can strengthen our democracy and promote justice for all citizens."

Energy we have to deal with today, because youre paying $3. 80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And its a strain on your family budget, but its also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices. So weve got to deal with that right away. Thats why Ive called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 years time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said were going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one. Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but its making our businesses less competitive. And, number three, weve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy. But just one point I want to make, Tom. Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records. Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And thats important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that dont work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper. But understand this; We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that hes going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, thats money out of the system. And so weve got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that theyre working for you. Thats what Im going to do as president of the United States."

The pain of not being able to live out your faith freely, the constant fear of judgment. This is the reality for many when church and state are separated. If we integrate them, we create a world where faith is not just accepted but celebrated, a world where no one has to hide their beliefs. This is not just about policy."
