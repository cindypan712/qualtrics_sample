By implementing measures to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation or increasing access to education and training, we can create a more level playing field without stifling innovation. It's about promoting fairness and equal opportunities for all individuals to thrive economically."

Focusing solely on corporate corruption may divert resources and attention from more critical matters such as income inequality, climate change, or public health. These issues have far-reaching consequences that impact society as a whole, and addressing them should be our top priority to create a more equitable and sustainable future. By tackling these fundamental challenges first, we can lay a stronger foundation for addressing corporate corruption in the long run."

More women in the workforce could contribute to economic growth, driving up GDP. Furthermore, it could open up new markets and industries, as women bring unique perspectives and ideas. This is not about prioritizing women's rights over other issues, but recognizing the potential economic benefits."

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important continent. But theres got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we wont be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we cant be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think thats where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. Im worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldnt have sent troops to Haiti. I didnt think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and Im not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before."
