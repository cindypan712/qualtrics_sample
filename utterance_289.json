I believe they foster a certain structure and discipline that flexible workplaces might not be able to achieve. This isn't necessarily a commentary on productivity or efficiency, but more a preference for the established order."

Children thrive in environments where they have both male and female role models to guide them through life's challenges. By deviating from the traditional family structure, we risk unsettling the foundation upon which healthy and stable societies are built. It's crucial to consider the long-term implications of redefining parenthood and ensure that we prioritize the best interests and holistic development."

However, the concern is still about the potential to exacerbate existing healthcare disparities. It's essential that any integration of genetic testing into healthcare is done responsibly and does not overshadow environmental, social, and lifestyle factors. This would need to be ensured for the principle of justice to be maintained."
