Upholding the greater good involves not only addressing immediate challenges but also safeguarding the foundational values that ensure long-term stability and justice. By advocating for ethical governance and the preservation of democratic norms, we can navigate crises effectively while upholding the integrity of our system."

By continually evaluating the impact of increased executive powers, maintaining robust checks and balances, and upholding the core values of democracy and justice, we can ensure that the greater good is served without compromising essential principles. It is crucial to approach governance with a thoughtful and ethical mindset."

Im in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. Ive also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. Weve got to recruit 100, 000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. Weve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one- on- one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre- school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10, 000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. Im here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15- year- old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. Shes the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They cant squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn."

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face disproportionate challenges in complying with complex privacy regulations compared to larger corporations with more resources. Excessive regulatory burdens can stifle growth and innovation, particularly for startups and SMEs that play a vital role in driving economic dynamism and job creation."

Junk food isn't just about satisfying our taste buds; it's about feeding our souls with nostalgia, comfort, and pure delight. We all deserve moments of unadulterated happiness, even if it means indulging in some crispy fries or gooey chocolate chip cookies. Let's not deny ourselves the simple pleasure of savor."

However, we must also acknowledge the deep-rooted inequalities that persist in our society. Affirmative action is a tool to address these disparities and create a more inclusive environment where everyone has a chance to succeed. It's about breaking down barriers and ensuring that individuals from all backgrounds are given a fair opportunity to showcase their talents and contribute meaning"

It can also help prepare them for environments where dress standards are non-negotiable, fostering a sense of compliance and respect for rules."

People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And my plan say why dont we pass 1. 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills? Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. There is a difference of opinion. My opponent thinks the government \u2014 the surplus is the governments money. Thats not what I think. I think its the hard- working people of Americas money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. Its a difference of opinion. Its a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself."
