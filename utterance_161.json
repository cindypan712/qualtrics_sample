Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six- party \u2014 or the six- point cease- fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st- century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th- century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15, 000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40, 000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your \u2014 what are the national security interests of the United States of America? And we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies."

Some kid who feels like \u2014 doesnt matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this persons head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. Were tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, youre automatically detained. And thats what needs to happen. Weve got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, thats important."

By prioritizing children, we can positively influence multiple areas of society simultaneously, leading to long-term positive outcomes for both children and the broader community. Child welfare programs can serve as a catalyst for broader societal improvements that benefit everyone in the long run."

Encouraging responsible content creation and consumption through education and media literacy programs can be more impactful than imposing regulations. It's vital to promote critical thinking skills and empower individuals to make informed choices rather than relying solely on restrictions. By fostering a culture of dialogue and understanding, we can address the root causes of violence in a more holistic and sustainable way."
