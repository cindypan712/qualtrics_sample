There are other means, such as documentaries, educational programs, and advocacy campaigns, that can effectively highlight these issues without subjecting individuals to graphic and distressing content in real-time. It is essential to find more responsible and compassionate ways to address violence in society without resorting to broadcasting such harmful content."

It's essential to strike a balance between addressing current hunger challenges and working towards a more sustainable future. By gradually shifting towards ethical and sustainable practices, we can ensure a more just and compassionate food system while also meeting the pressing needs of vulnerable populations. It's a delicate balance that requires thoughtful consideration of both short-term and long-term impact."
