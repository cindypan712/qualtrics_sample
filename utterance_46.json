We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, youre automatically detained. And thats what needs to happen. Weve got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, thats important."

For example, the US already outspends other countries on defense by a large margin, yet it doesn't always translate to effectiveness in achieving strategic objectives.

Therefore, I maintain that we should not enhance US foreign relations at this time."
