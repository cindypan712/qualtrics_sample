And whats interesting is, its a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasnt a threat. If hed let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldnt have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while theyre doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. For two years, the president didnt even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and were less safe. So what do we do? Weve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, whove been involved, in their initiative. Weve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the presidents been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, its going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Ive proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. Its very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when youre busy developing a new one. Im going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough."

It's important to consider that each child is unique, and strategies effective for one might not be for another. Additionally, standardized parenting might not account for variations in cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds. Hence, I insist that we should not enforce standardized parenting practices."

We can address food insecurity and promote healthy eating habits without further government intervention. It's about finding other effective solutions that do not involve expanding the role of the federal government."
