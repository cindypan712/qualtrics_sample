The electoral college system aims to provide a voice to less populous states, yet it can undermine the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" as the weight of an individual's vote can vary by state.

Regulation could encourage more creativity in storytelling, leading to a more vibrant and diverse media landscape. Moreover, regulations could help media outlets better cater to their audience's preferences, as not all viewers are comfortable with high levels of violence."
