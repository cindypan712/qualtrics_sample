The inherent drive for profit maximization can lead to unethical practices, such as exploitation of workers, environmental degradation, and prioritizing short-term gains over long-term sustainability. A truly ethical economic system should prioritize the well-being of all individuals and ensure that wealth and resources are distributed fairly, rather than concentrating power and resources in the hands of a few. By moving away from capitalism and"

But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is weve got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want \u2014 I want tax cuts for the middle- class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple- dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African- American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. Its not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security. And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security. Im totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes."

Additionally, the lack of standardized assessment in homeschooling makes it challenging to ensure that students are meeting educational standards. It's crucial to prioritize the overall academic development and future opportunities."

I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. Thats what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I dont know if you have to be a paperwork filler- outer, but most of its because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice Presidents plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of its because you cant \u2014 you cant control the classroom. You cant have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So Im going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but dont fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level."

For instance, geofencing technology can prevent drones from entering restricted airspace, reducing the likelihood of collisions with manned aircraft. Moreover, advancements in drone technology, such as collision avoidance systems, further enhance overall safety measures. As for potential job displacement, history has shown that technological advancements often create new job opportunities. In the case of drones, industries can shift human resources to more skilled"
