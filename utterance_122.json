We just have a different philosophy. Let me talk about tax relief. If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief. The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I dont think thats the role of the president to pick youre right and youre not right. I think if youre going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it. And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1% will end up paying one- third of the taxes in America and they get one- fifth of the benefits. And thats because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes. If youre a family of four making $50, 000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes. What Ive done is set priorities and funded them. And theres extra money. And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back. Its a difference of opinion. He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money. I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people. Its just the right position to take."

The pain of not being able to live out your faith freely, the constant fear of judgment. This is the reality for many when church and state are separated. If we integrate them, we create a world where faith is not just accepted but celebrated, a world where no one has to hide their beliefs. This is not just about policy."

In some cases, prioritizing human rights above all else can lead to interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, causing political instability and conflict. This interference can sometimes do more harm than good, disrupting delicate balances and exacerbating existing tensions. It's essential to consider the complexities of each situation and the potential unintended consequences of imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to human rights worldwide."
