By taking a strategic approach tailored to different sectors and regions, we can aim to strike that balance effectively. It's about adapting our response to address both public health needs and economic concerns in a nuanced way."

By strengthening the EPA, we can establish a solid foundation for environmental protection while still allowing room for innovation and diverse approaches within the regulatory framework. Would you be open to exploring how a strengthened EPA can work in conjunction with other stakeholders to achieve comprehensive environmental sustainability goals?"

Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people \u2013 a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."

Based on statistics, the existing system has been successful in reducing crime rates in various regions over the past years. I think instead of reform, we should focus on improving the implementation of current laws and regulations. Changing the system may risk losing the progress we have already made."
