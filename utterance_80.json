By finding a balance between encouraging new perspectives and leveraging the expertise of seasoned politicians, we can work towards a more inclusive and accountable government that serves the diverse needs of the population."

Rather than focusing on impeachment, we should instead concentrate on the merits of the existing administration. It is important to strive for unity and progress, rather than division."

By focusing solely on expanding access to abortion services, we may unintentionally neglect the importance of comprehensive support systems for women facing unplanned pregnancies. Instead of solely relying on abortion as a solution, we should prioritize resources towards education, healthcare, and social services that empower women to make informed decisions and provide alternatives."

A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But theres also the issue of responsibility. Youve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow weve lost that accountability. Ive been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today \u2014 and Im afraid on Wall Street \u2014 greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption \u2014 or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen."

By implementing targeted policies that promote economic mobility, such as enhancing access to education and training, we can create a more equitable and prosperous society in the long run. It's about finding a balance that ensures both economic incentives and social fairness are prioritized to achieve sustainable growth and reduce income inequality effectively."

What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track."
