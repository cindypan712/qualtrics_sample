More surveillance means more data, and managing this data could be a logistical challenge. Also, the cost of implementing and maintaining a larger surveillance system could be exorbitant. There's also the question of effectiveness - we need to ensure that increased surveillance would indeed lead to a significant reduction in crime or threat levels. Is there evidence to support this correlation?"

This is not because I fear potential negative effects, but because I strongly believe in the importance of human touch in all sectors. Using drones may seem impressive, but it does not hold the same level of human interaction and involvement."

And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top- level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. Now, I think thats the right strategy; I think thats the right policy. And, John, I \u2014 youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I dont know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that its difficult. This is not an easy situation. Youve got cross- border attacks against U. S. troops. And weve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti- democratic. We had a 20th- century mindset that basically said, \u201cWell, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator. \u201d And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they werent going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. Thats going to change when Im president of the United States."

By having robust surveillance systems in place, law enforcement can more effectively track and apprehend criminals, ultimately making communities safer. Additionally, the deterrence effect of knowing that one is being watched can discourage individuals from engaging in illegal activities in the first place. It's about striking a balance between security and privacy to ensure the safety."

By artificially supporting certain sectors, the government can distort market signals, which can lead to misallocation of resources and stifle economic growth. Stimulus packages can also create fiscal imbalances that could affect economic stability in the future."
