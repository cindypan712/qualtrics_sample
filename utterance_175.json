I remember the vice president saying, \u201cJust give us a chance to get up there, were going to make sure you get tax cuts. \u201d It didnt happen. Now hes having to say that again. Theyve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice presidents expenditures. Its been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means hell either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20, 000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents. We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder."

It's not just about biology, it's about empowering our youth with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships. We can't afford to keep important information from them, especially when it comes to their health and well-being. Let's ensure they have the tools to navigate the complexities of relationships and sexuality in a safe and healthy way."

But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think its going to keep America safe. And Im glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy."
