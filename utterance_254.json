The US is a global leader, and with that comes a duty to promote justice and fairness on a worldwide scale. By engaging in international trade, we're not only creating opportunities for our citizens, but also supporting developing economies and helping to eradicate poverty and inequality globally. Furthermore, globalization fosters peace and mutual understanding. Rejecting it would go against our values of compassion and global solidarity."

Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and theyre angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending. Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed. He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, lets look at our records, Senator Obama. Lets look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations. I have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue."

Studies have shown that for about half of seniors, Social Security provides the majority of their income. Moreover, private savings and investment options may not be sufficient or accessible to all individuals, especially those with lower incomes or limited financial literacy. Enhancing Social Security alongside promoting personal savings can create a more inclusive and effective retirement system that addresses the needs of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status."

Health- care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision- making process. Most health- care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And theres no market forces involved with health care. Its one of the reasons Im a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low- premium, high- deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax- free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision- making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits \u2014 I dont believe, I know \u2014 that the lawsuits are causing health- care costs to rise in America. Thats why Im such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didnt include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why theres still high cost in medicine is because this is \u2014 they dont use any information technology. Its like if you looked at the \u2014 its the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, weve got to introduce high technology into health care. Were beginning to do it. Were changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health- care field is fully integrated with information technology, itll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care."

For example, in medicine, targeted gene therapies can provide life-saving treatments for individuals with genetic disorders. In agriculture, genetically modified crops can help address food insecurity and reduce the need for harmful pesticides. By weighing the risks against the benefits and implementing strict safety protocols, we can make informed decisions about when and how to use genetic engineering responsibly."
