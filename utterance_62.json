But theres no doubt theres a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. Im not for command and control techniques either. Im for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we dont know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. Its pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this. Look, the worlds temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. What are we going to tell our children? Im a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when Im in my later years that I didnt turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it is \u2014 its written in the book of Matthew, \u201cWhere your heart is, there is your treasure also. \u201d And I believe that \u2014 that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way thats good for them."

By focusing solely on Native American rights, we may inadvertently neglect the needs of other vulnerable populations who are also deserving of support and resources. It is essential to strive for justice and equality for all, taking into account the greater good of society."

By opening up trade barriers, we can access new markets, increase efficiency through specialization, and attract foreign investment. This can lead to economic growth, job creation, and overall prosperity for the country. What are your thoughts on this perspective?"

In reality, the quality of care provided under such systems can vary significantly, with some individuals experiencing subpar treatment due to resource constraints and government bureaucracy. Moreover, the taxes required to fund universal health care can place a significant financial burden on taxpayers, potentially stifling economic growth and innovation in other sectors. It's crucial to strike a balance between"

Increasing economic ties with China can also pose risks, such as dependence on their market and potential loss of domestic jobs. Furthermore, China's human rights abuses and aggressive territorial actions raise concerns about supporting their regime through enhanced relations. It's essential to consider the negative consequences and potential threats to national security that could arise from deepening ties with a country that doesn't align with democratic values and principles."

With legalization, we can regulate and control its use, allowing for more structured studies. Additionally, the increased tax revenue from its sale can be used to fund the development of better detection methods for impaired driving."

Actually, Mr. Vice President, its not true. I do support a national patients bill of rights. As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patients bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and thats what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patients bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesnt have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you cant gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, cant gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. Were one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now theres whats called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesnt follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. Its time for our nation to come together and do whats right for the people, and I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patients bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered. I dont want the law to supersede good law like weve got in Texas. I think \u2014"
