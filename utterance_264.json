It's a strategy that some candidates use, not necessarily because it's effective, but because it's a part of the game. It's not always about highlighting the weaknesses of opponents, but rather it's a way to keep the debate alive and the public engaged."

Additionally, self-driving cars still cannot handle unpredictable situations or complex driving conditions as effectively as humans. We should also consider the high cost of these vehicles, which could limit their accessibility to a wider population."

Not only \u2014 Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities."

Prioritizing the mission readiness and overall effectiveness of the military is paramount in making decisions that may impact its core functions."
